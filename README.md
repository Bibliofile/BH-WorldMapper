# BH-WorldMapper
Turn a folder full of 32x32 pixel images into a map for your server

This is only as perfect as the user. It will only map parts of the world which you have looked at. If you are an admin you must look everywhere to make a complete map. This can take anywhere between 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on the size of the world. 

To use this product, explore as much of the world as is possible. Then connect your device to a computer and download the applicable folder within the "map" folder of the world. 

Once you have downloaded it launch the application. 

Choose the folder you downloaded, pick the applicable world size, and click generate map! Depending on how much you explored, this can take several minutes. 

Once you have generated the image, click save and save the file with a .bmp extension. Due to the extremely large size of these images, paint is unable to handle them in this format. To make them a manageable size, open GIMP (or Photoshop) and press ctrl+shift+e to export the image as a PNG. This can reduce the size of a world map from over 260mb down to under 5mb*.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you choose the wrong world size, it the application will still function. However, it will only map as much of the world as would exist if the world was the smaller size. This is found starting at the North Pole and going right. If you choose a larger world size than is applicable you will simply increase the size of the image generated. 

This product has not yet been tested on a 16x world.
